# Music-shop
Why am I doing this ?

I am creating a Music shop applciation where I can simulate the procedures of an actual online store using CRUD to store data and a functioning API connection for that ability. This will also inculde testing to see if code can actually work and reproduce the expected outcome.

How do I expect the challenge to go ?

I am expecting there to be a few issues but I plan to be able to perfrom CRUD with data stored into my database, connection of APIs delivering this in through Postman.
I plan to add features of a cart, log in, user, address all to add to performance of my app. This going for the same of the database as all data entered should be able to be input into the database as well.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
Inital write out of of code for the program was good with setting up of classes and getters and setters and Constructors and even wrtiing of CRUD fucntions. But problems I have is I am missing dependecies, my code isn't responding and motivation is lost now as the bare essential is missing.


Possible improvements for futre revisions of the project?
Improvements for the project would be more adequte time to meet my schedule as whilest trying to write and develop this program. There have been time restrictions that are out of my control, hindering the time and practice I can dedicate to this includig issues with the amount of resources covered needing more time to fully understand being able to work these into my program.


Screenshots showign the Postman requests and output from API.
There are no screenshots as I am not able to complete the CRUD or really work the postman at this time. 


Screenshots of databse to to prove that data is beign persisted.
There are no screenshots as there was no ability to input data into the databse.
