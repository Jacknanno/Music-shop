# Music-shop
Why am I doing this ?

I am creating a Music shop applciation where I can simulate the procedures of an actual online store using CRUD to store data and a functioning API connection for that ability. This will also inculde testing to see if code can actually work and reproduce the expected outcome.

How do I expect the challenge to go ?

I am expecting there to be a few issues but I plan to be able to perfrom CRUD with data stored into my database, connection of APIs delivering this in through Postman.
I plan to add features of a cart, log in, user, address all to add to performance of my app. This going for the same of the database as all data entered should be able to be input into the database as well.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?


Possible improvements for futre revisions of the project?
